### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Poppins";
  src: url(design/fonts/Poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf) format("truetype");
}
```

```css
:root {
  /* Color Variables */
  --Cyan: hsl(180, 62%, 55%);
  --red: hsl(0, 78%, 62%);
  --Orange: hsl(34, 97%, 64%);
  --Blue: hsl(212, 86%, 64%);
  --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --Grey400: hsl(212, 6%, 44%);
  --Grey500: hsl(234, 12%, 34%);
}
```

```css
.icon {
  display: block;
  margin: 15px 0 0 auto;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm planning to learn more about css variables and responsiveness
